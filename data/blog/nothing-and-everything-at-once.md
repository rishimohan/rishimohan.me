Sitting at my desk, listening to Jagjit Singh's ghazal.
It's a very beautiful night here in Berlin right now,
windy, just the right windy, the kind which makes me bend on the
windows to feel the wind on my face

It's cold, just right enough to make me recall all the similar moments
I've lived before. The sound trees are making, moved by the winds,
I love it

My mornings are starting with reading messages, and so are the days and evenings
and nights. Messages from customers, who have some feedback to share,
or have kind words to share

[Orshot is a $1,000 a month SaaS now](https://daskrad.com), it crossed the mark yesterday. I feel it's already [ahead of competitors](https://orshot.com/blog/bannerbear-api-alternative) in value, UX etc., still a long way to go

Pushing on code like water pours in rains, pursuing marketing as if I'm an expert and managing time like there's no tomorrow

I've been working on it day and night since last 5 or so months since I decided to go full-time on this dream(and put a break on others ðŸ˜‚). It's exciting, rewarding and exhausting(very) at the same time

The best part is I wake up every day feeling with a fulfilling feeling and excitedly. There's whole bunch of things I want to do and I look forward to my day to work on those

Even though all of that, there's other part of my life which is no short of a beautiful mess. Hiring myself through EOR, social life in ashes, zero travel, shaadi pressure and what not

There were weeks when I couldn't sit at home, and wanted to go travel around different cities in EU and check-in into most aesthetic of Airbnbs and chill and have coffee in a random outdoor sitting cafe in late afternoon

And then there's now, a phase that **I've accepted as to one where it seems nothing is happening, and then everything happens all at once**
