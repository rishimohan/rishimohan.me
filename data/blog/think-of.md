None of the theories, like the invisible thread theory would make sense
to anyone. It sounds rubbish, until you experience it

You just know things, you feel it, call it the thread,
however broken, old and burnt it is. The thing is,
it's there, it's still there

You know it because, you can feel the peeping,
in the moments that come out random, out of blue.
You know it because of the wind, the voices,
the touch of the thread

You know it because the thread is not just tied to the body,
it's tying the soul, and maybe when the soul
tries to go a bit too far more than it's meant to,
the thread does its job, sometimes in nights,
or after lunch, in random thoughts, in random searches

It's nothing short of magic, how this works.
But I just know, you know how?

I know because I do too
