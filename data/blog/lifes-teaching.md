excerpt: Sometimes, and just sometimes, you flow, bend against the storm, and it through its winds carries your weight. And you fly, you flow
---

This is a storm. And I'm, me! right in the middle of it

The space where you don't feel the full force of it,
or maybe because you've been through it for so long
you fail to realize what you're holding on

All the wind is blurring my eyes, quite literally!
And you know how the eyes get watery when it's too windy?
I'm in that, all the time, quite literally!

And when you stand against too much of it, your skin gets dry!
And when you feel too much of it, and for a long time,
you make it your temporary home. And now, that is how home feels like,
chaos, days and nights into the void, right outta window

Sometimes, and just sometimes, you flow, bend against the storm,
and it through its winds carries your weight. And you fly, you flow

But you can't do it, you can't depend on the storm,
and you gotta stop believing that you're meant to be there

It's dangerous how much we're ready to face when we're by ourselves

Life's teaching, I hope I'm learning
