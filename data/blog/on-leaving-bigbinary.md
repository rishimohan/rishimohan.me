This is my last week at [BigBinary](https://bigbinary.com). 
I've worked here for 6 years as UI Engineer.

Working at BigBinary helped me grow not only professionally
but also personally. It helped me socialize, 
attend conferences where I made friends and
being a fully remote company
helped me pursue my interest of travelling 
which is a big thing. All of it helped me in building
the personality that I have, which is definitely an upgrade
from what I was when I joined BigBinary. 

I feel lucky enough to have worked with BB as second 
company in my career. I've gotten chance to work with 
some amazing folks in BB who directly or indiretly have inspired me.

*Here's a GIF of my favorite times at BB, 
when we went to FML in Pune.*
