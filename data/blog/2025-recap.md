![2025 Recap](/images/posts/2025-recap.png)

In couple of days and it'll be 2026. Perfect time to look back
in time to what this year has done to me

A lot has happened in this year, in its months, days, minutes and fleeting moments

> A lot of what has happened in 2025 is not what I expected or wanted,
> but I know I needed it for what I'm to become

## Start

The year started in Goa spending peaceful time doing my favourite things,
while I was waiting to join Xata

I was excited but it was short-lived, after working for 2 months
I was let go

It should've felt disappointing, but it was meant to be.
I know it because not a single cell in my body felt I'm losing,
it was opposite and it felt and feels like this is what I should've done long back

I've worked almost 10 years in multiple jobs,
and I'm grateful for each of the opportunity I've gotten.
All of those shaped me well

But deep down in the start of the year, while I started working on Orshot
I knew I'm passionate about building, and more so ever my own stuff.
It was just a matter of push, and Xata gave me that by laying me off

And so I started working full-time on [my own company](https://daskrad.com)

I got to travel to Iceland via Xata's offsite,
and then I spent good time in Cinque Terre, Pisa for my birthday trip

And while at it I had to figure out my Visa in Germany while
growing Orshot. It was overwhelming I wouldn't lie,
but it wasn't something that I let took over me

All the credit goes to the people in my life,
family, friends, they got me going and stronger

## Mid

I decided hiring myself to support my Visa,
and have been paying myself a salary since last couple of months.
I also gave my Lid Test, German A1 test and surprisignly
cleared both in the first take

All of these took bunch of my time in appointments, preparations,
which I had better spent in what I love, work on Orshot,
or travelling

But kuch paane ke liye kuch khona bhi padta hai!
Azaad hone se pehle, qaid bhi hona padta hai

## End

Last couple of months were mostly about
realizing the journey of this year,
and how things have starting to make sense

It made me realize not everything needs to be in my control,
and the importance of patience and being calm,
emotionally and mentally

I've ignored my health this year,
working days and nights, more than I ever did with any job.
I like how the passion kicks-in,
sometimes too much that I didn't know
which day of the month it was.
Or if it's weekend or if I had lunch

This is the spark I don't want to lose,
the satisfaction of playing my own tunes is unmatched

This is what I want to do now.
A company that I run,
work that I love,
people that I care for,
be free and travel with no borders.
Realizing these feels more closer to now

## Highlights of 2025

- 💼 Registerd [my own company](/blog/registering-daskrad)
- 👔 Dressed well, lived in the moment, made meaningful connections

- ✨ Even in my lowest this year, didn't let my standards down. In fact, the more I faced the ground, the more my standards grew
- 🤍 Started to take control of situations beyond my likes and desires

More of what happened this year was within me than in the outside life,
and even though it felt a little uncomfortable,
**uncomfortable is what I strictly needed**

Reminds me of these lines from [Usey Kehna](/blog/usey-kehna)

```
meri chot bhi ek bhool hai
hai ussi se mehekti bahaar meri
```

Things have started to ease, as they always do

## What's in 2026?

I don't want to write about it. I want to let it happen

All I know is, I see it clearly 😃
