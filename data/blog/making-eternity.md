What is eternal? And more importantly, how does anything becomes eternal?

My recent ponderings took me a walk in the past,
where so far I've realized this is how it works

You love something, too much, enough to not stop thinking about it

But then, all you do is think, you don't do anything about it.
And so, you would do 1000 other things in your life,
but not do that one thing

And you'll turn 30, 40 and 100,
and that thing that you've always thought about and never did,
or could not do for any reasons, eventually becomes eternal

It stays with you, comes back again and again

Imagine starting something you love, but not finishing it.
You'll spend many moments and decades thinking about it,
what ifs, it'll stay with you in a mystery you never uncovered

And so when you go, you still have that thing you loved,
that goes with you, an incomplete wish,
an unexplored path, that you always wished to experience

It sounds like a bad thing, and most times it probably is.
But if you think it in other ways,
it's not nessaccarily a bad thing.
Probably a good thing in disguise

It's always the things
that don't leave you, or maybe you don't leave them

And so, are you making eternity?
