![Commitments - Rishi Mohan](/images/posts/commitments.jpg)

Unless situational, all the things we pursue in our life are out of interest

Jobs, relationships, hobbies, gym, could be anything

And after pursuing that interest for some time we get into routine of doing it.
And eventually we either get tired or bored of it.
And there's a reason any of the interests you would pursue,
_would fade after some time_

And it's because, **we humans are not meant to live a routinely life**,
and so nothing sticks forever

We can pursue anything for a long time, get tired of it,
and part ways with the interest to pick a new one

> I believe the essence of anything comes from the commitment

Even if you don't feel like continuing with that interest,
if you still keep doing it you'll eventually come to a point which will
open a new form of the same interest.
Something that would be more interesting,
more powerful and stronger than your previous ties with that interest

And that's the reward you get by committing.
Committing to something even after you're bored,
is what leads you to a door that you never imagined was there

I believe that's how everything that's strong in this world
happens, relationships, jobs, hobbies. **That's the reward of commitments**
