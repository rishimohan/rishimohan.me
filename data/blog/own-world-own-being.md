We all have two pair of eyes, and we all see things differently.
It's essentially a unique world for each of us

The way we see the world is significantly different from the day
we start seeing, to what we are now

Fortunately or unfortunately, it changes

In the early days, when we are babies, we don't have enough of the world.
Our perpection is largely made of the innocence we're born with,
no filters, no influence, just pure eyes looking at the world
and appreciating it

As we grow, we have experiences, good and bad,
that builds up filters to how we see what we see.
For ex., your perception of a friend or partner changes
as you spend more time with them or have more experiences together

It happens with the people we know and who we let in in our life,
or let out from our life

> But there's this, **the privilege of seeing a person as is**

It's when you filter YOUR experiences, YOUR beliefs,
YOUR rights and wrongs to see a person you know or you don't,
as they are

It's not something we do by default as we grow up,
but it's something we should do more often.
Some might say it's a privilege for others
on how we see them as they are, I say the privilege is ours

And when you do it, you will know _how every person is a beauty of a creature,
a perfection, in their own world, in their own being_
