Orshot helps automating generation of marketing assets
like banners, ads, mockups etc.

You can generate Images and PDFs on Orshot using pre-designed
templates, and also design your own templates using Orshot Studio.
And then you can dynamically generate assets from these templates

My goal with Orshot is to help everyone
design anything once and automate it easily
with API, SDKs and integrations
