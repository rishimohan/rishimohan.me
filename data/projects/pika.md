![Pika Screenshot](/images/work/show/pika-preview.png)

Created Pika to quickly generate shareable screenshots
from boring screenshots. Previous workflow included
involvement of Figma in which I had to open the app
and then figure out the background gradient and shadows etc.

Here's how it works:

- You just paste your screenshot
- Customize the screenshot, add background, shadow etc.
- Copy the output image, or save it as PNG on your machine

Pika saves your previous settings so when you load it again,
it'll retain your last settings.

Pika is open-source and 
the [code is available at Github](http://github.com/rishimohan/pika).

**Update (April 18, 2022)**

- Added a new tool in Pika to 
[generate Open Graph and marketing images](https://pika.style/open-graph-generator)
