Qurb lets you generate mockup for iPhone X/XS/Max, iPad, MacBook and other devices quickly. Just select the device, add your screenshot and save the mockup. All the devices are designed in CSS, thanks to [Oleg](https://marvelapp.github.io/devices.css/). Also when you add your screenshot, it's not uploaded anywhere.
